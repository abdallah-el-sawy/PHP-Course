/* 
To Run PHP we need 
1) Xampp program 
2) vs code 

after installation 
open xampp control panel as adminstrator and start the apache to run the server
if there is any problems search it in google maybe you have another program that takes the same port that apache and mysql takes

after that the code is written in htdocs 

this file is inside
open the C then go to xampp file then htdocs 

and enjoy :)
